            Jenna is a senior currently studying Graphic Design at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). She is a double minor: Art History, and Risk Management & Insurance. Her practice is focused heavily on the importance of research in both the design and iterative processes. She hopes to incorporate more historical based work, and writing elements, into her practice. She also has the hopes of including historical queer culture into her work—giving voices to those that no longer have them. Her work has been shown in Italy, North Caolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. She worked on a research project to redesign the 1755 Mitchell Map to highlight the landmarks of the Cherokee people, exploring her fascination with cartography.

                    <em>Scales of Indifference</em> initially began as an opportunity to showcase an underrepresented art discipline in a fine arts space. Curators and Graphic Design students, Jenna Casey and Zach Montgomery set out with this in mind, working tirelessly to materialize this vision. Similar to the show’s objective of broadening preconceived notions of time, the variety of media displayed in this space also works to advance perspectives of Graphic Design as an interdisciplinary and unrestricted practice.

                   [re]presented is a reader with the goal of re-presenting history as it relates to the relationship of homosexuality within the Nazi ranks. It explores the foundation of homosexuality leading up to, and during, World War II. This reader is a collection of scholarly and personal writing on a topic that is overlooked in history, especially in a time where the same issues are arising again.

                    This is focusing on the emotional/psychological aspects of studying abroad. I completed a daily writing practice that I accompanied with a map of Florence, overlaying the writings where I was having these moments of reflection. I wanted to focus on the lesser talked about aspects of studying abroad: the emotional setbacks & growth.

                            recirculated explores the nature of recirculating a piece of text, and empasizing the design choices that emulate the purpose of the text. This was a republication of chapter 1 of “The Memory Police” by Yoko Ogawa, looking into typefaces that emphasized the plot of the book: your memories being taken from you and you being left with no control over it. The size played off of the idea that this could be a “pocket” book full of your memories — something that can travel with you. The text, "The Memory Police", in a sense shatters what we know as the foundation of our own memory, which is further embodied through the scatteration of the text as the pages progress.

                        Dear Citizens... is an information guide on how to reimagine World War II propaganda in a modernist view, and is essentially a how-to guide for others to follow. There are added elements of redaction to emulate the layouts of how government documents are released to the public for viewing and research purposes. This was a heavily research based project looking into the aesthetic of propaganda during the war effort as compared to the aesthetic of today’s advertising efforts.

This book was made to romanticize these horrific battles from an outside look into the aesthetic of WWII propaganda and take a modern spin on it.

                        patchwork of lives is focusing on the idea that who we are now, and who we become, is a collection of the people we have interacted with. We pick up tendencies, likes, habits, mannerisms, etc, from people in our life that we take with us as we get older. This is a collection of "mementos" people have gathered from those around them. The pages have ink on them as it is interacted with to emphasize how the book is a collection of those around it, like how our current self is a collection of those around us.
